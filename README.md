# Moving-Eyes

This project allows for two-eye (as styled by CSS) synchronous novement to occur upon initiated mouse movement. 

How to Run: In order to run this, you have to download all three files: .html, .css and .js. They must all be stored in the same folder in order to run together and animate the movement. 

Roadmap of future improvements: This exercise could be improved by further styling as well as attached to a graphic scene (e.g., Halloween haunted house) which can trigger the movement at a specific time (i.e. when the user engages with the scene in a particular sequence) rather than continuous.

This should include information about the MIT license.
